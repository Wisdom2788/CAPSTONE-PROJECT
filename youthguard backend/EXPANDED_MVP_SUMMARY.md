### 2. Lesson Model
Represents individual lessons within courses, including content, video URL, duration, and order index.

### 3. Job Model
Represents job postings with details like title, description, company, location, job type, salary range, requirements, and application deadline.

### 4. Application Model
Represents job applications with cover letter, resume URL, status, and feedback.

### 5. Message Model
Represents messages between users with content, read status, and timestamps.

### 6. Progress Model
Tracks user progress through courses and lessons with completion status, time spent, and scores.

## Services Layer Expansion

### 1. CourseService
Handles all business logic related to courses and lessons, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.

### 2. JobService
Manages job postings and applications, with features for creating jobs, applying for positions, and tracking applications.

### 3. MessageService
Manages messaging functionality, including sending messages, retrieving conversation history, and tracking read status.

### 4. ProgressService
Handles progress tracking functionality, including updating progress, calculating completion percentages, and retrieving progress reports.

## Controllers Layer Expansion

### 1. CourseController
Handles all HTTP requests related to courses and lessons.

### 2. JobController
Handles all HTTP requests related to jobs and applications.

### 3. MessageController
Handles all HTTP requests related to messaging.

### 4. ProgressController
Handles all HTTP requests related to progress tracking.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Learning Management
- Course creation and management
- Lesson organization within courses
- Progress tracking for learners

### 2. Job Marketplace
- Job posting and management
- Application submission and tracking
- Candidate matching based on skills

### 3. Communication System
- Real-time messaging between users
- Read status tracking
- Unread message notifications

### 4. Progress Tracking
- Detailed progress monitoring
- Completion percentage calculation
- Learning analytics

## Clean Code Principles Maintained

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each class and method has one clear purpose and responsibility.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle
Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.

### 3. Meaningful Naming
All classes, methods, and variables use descriptive, meaningful names.

### 4. Small Functions
Methods are kept small and focused on single tasks.

### 5. Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages.

### 6. Documentation
Clear documentation and comments explaining complex logic.

## Testing and Validation

All new endpoints have been tested and verified to work correctly:

✅ User registration and authentication
✅ Course creation and management
✅ Job posting and application
✅ Messaging system
✅ Progress tracking
✅ Error handling for invalid requests
✅ Data validation and sanitization

## API Response Standards

All endpoints follow consistent response formats:

### Success Responses
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Descriptive success message",
  "data": { }
}
```

### Error Responses
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Descriptive error message"
}
```

## HTTP Status Codes

- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Internal Server Error

## Database Design

The expanded MVP uses MongoDB with the following collections:

1. `simple_users`: User accounts and profiles
2. `courses`: Educational courses
3. `lessons`: Course lessons
4. `jobs`: Job postings
5. `applications`: Job applications
6. `messages`: User messages
7. `progress`: Learning progress tracking

## Security Considerations

1. Password hashing for user authentication
2. JWT token-based session management
3. Input validation and sanitization
4. Error message sanitization to prevent information leakage
5. Proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios

## Scalability Features

1. Modular architecture allowing easy addition of new features
2. Separation of concerns between models, services, and controllers
3. Consistent API design patterns
4. Efficient database queries with proper indexing

## Next Steps for Frontend Integration

The expanded MVP provides a comprehensive backend for building a full-featured frontend application with:

1. User authentication and profile management
2. Course browsing and enrollment
3. Job searching and application
4. Messaging between users
5. Progress tracking and analytics

All endpoints are ready for integration with a frontend application built using modern frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular.
