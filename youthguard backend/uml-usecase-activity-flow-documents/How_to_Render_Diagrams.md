# How to Render Your YouthGuard UML Diagrams

## Visual Diagram Generation

Your PlantUML files can be rendered into visual diagrams like the samples you showed. Here are several ways to do this:

## Method 1: Online PlantUML Editor (Easiest)
1. Go to [http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml)
2. Copy and paste any of your `.puml` files content
3. Click "Submit" to generate the visual diagram
4. Download the image (PNG, SVG, or PDF format)

## Method 2: VS Code Extension
1. Install "PlantUML" extension in VS Code
2. Open any `.puml` file
3. Press `Alt + D` to preview the diagram
4. Right-click to export as image

## Method 3: PlantUML Desktop Application
1. Download PlantUML JAR file from [plantuml.com](http://plantuml.com/download)
2. Install Java if not already installed
3. Run: `java -jar plantuml.jar YourDiagramFile.puml`
4. This generates PNG files automatically

## Method 4: Online Tools
- **PlantText**: [www.planttext.com](http://www.planttext.com)
- **PlantUML QEditor**: [sujoyu.github.io/plantuml-qeditor/](https://sujoyu.github.io/plantuml-qeditor/)

## Your Diagram Files Ready for Rendering:
1. `YouthGuard_UseCase_Diagram.puml` - Use Case Diagram
2. `YouthGuard_Class_Diagram.puml` - Class Diagram  
3. `YouthGuard_Activity_Registration.puml` - Registration Flow
4. `YouthGuard_Activity_Learning.puml` - Learning Flow
5. `YouthGuard_Activity_JobApplication.puml` - Job Application Flow
6. `YouthGuard_Activity_Messaging.puml` - Messaging Flow
7. `YouthGuard_Sequence_Authentication.puml` - Authentication Sequence
8. `YouthGuard_Sequence_Learning.puml` - Learning Sequence
9. `YouthGuard_System_Architecture.puml` - System Architecture

## Sample Output
When rendered, your diagrams will look exactly like professional UML diagrams with:
- Classes with attributes and methods (like your first sample)
- Activity flows with decision diamonds (like your second sample)  
- Use cases with actors and relationships (like your third sample)

## For Your Capstone Project
I recommend:
1. Render all diagrams as PNG or PDF files
2. Include them in your presentation
3. Use the documentation files as explanatory text
4. Reference the technical analysis for detailed explanations
