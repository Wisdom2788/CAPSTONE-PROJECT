# Remove Dashboard Content

## Changes Made

Removed the following elements from the welcome back card in the DashboardPage:
1. "YouthGuard Dashboard" text
2. "Your learning journey starts here" text
3. The logo (shield icon with circular background)

### Files Modified

- `pages/DashboardPage.tsx`

## Details

The content inside the visual dashboard illustration area has been removed, leaving only the gradient background container. The welcome back card now only contains:
- Welcome message with user's first name
- Description text about continuing the journey
- An empty gradient background container

This change creates an even cleaner, more minimal dashboard experience for users.

## Testing

To test this change:

1. Open the application and navigate to the Dashboard page
2. Verify that the "YouthGuard Dashboard" text, "Your learning journey starts here" text, and the shield logo are no longer visible in the welcome back card
3. Confirm that the layout still looks balanced and visually appealing
4. Ensure that the empty gradient container doesn't look out of place

## Impact

This change further simplifies the user interface by removing additional decorative elements, creating a more focused and minimal dashboard experience for users.
