# Fix Page Refresh Authentication Issue

## Problem

When a user logs in to the dashboard or routes to any of the pages in the sidebar and chooses to refresh the browser, it routes back to the landing page unless the user logs out. This happens because the ProtectedRoute component doesn't wait for the authentication check to complete before making navigation decisions.

## Solution

Updated the authentication system to properly handle page refreshes by:

1. Adding an `authCheckComplete` state to track when the authentication check is finished
2. Modifying the ProtectedRoute component to wait for the authentication check before navigating

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

1. `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Added `authCheckComplete` state to track when authentication check is complete
   - Updated the `useEffect` hook to set `authCheckComplete` to true after checking localStorage
   - Updated the `logout` function to set `authCheckComplete` to true
   - Added `authCheckComplete` to the context value

2. `App.tsx`
   - Updated the ProtectedRoute component to use the `authCheckComplete` state
   - Added a loading spinner while authentication check is in progress
   - Modified navigation logic to only redirect when auth check is complete

## Details

The issue was that when a page is refreshed, the AuthContext is reinitialized and there's a brief moment where `isAuthenticated` might be false before the `useEffect` in AuthContext has a chance to check localStorage. This caused the ProtectedRoute to immediately navigate to the landing page.

With the fix:
1. When the app loads, ProtectedRoute shows a loading spinner while checking authentication
2. Once the authentication check is complete, ProtectedRoute makes the correct navigation decision
3. Authenticated users stay on their current page after refresh
4. Unauthenticated users are redirected to the landing page

## Testing

To test this change:

1. Open the application and log in
2. Navigate to any protected page (e.g., /courses, /jobs, /messages)
3. Refresh the browser
4. Verify that:
   - The page shows a loading spinner briefly while checking authentication
   - The user remains on the same page after refresh
   - Navigation to protected routes still works correctly
   - Unauthenticated users are still redirected to the landing page

## Impact

This change ensures that authenticated users can refresh any page without being redirected to the landing page, providing a better user experience while maintaining proper authentication protection.
