# Image Display Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. Course cards were not displaying images properly due to:
   - Empty or missing thumbnail URLs in sample data
   - No error handling for broken image links
   - Poor quality placeholder images

2. TypeScript errors in animation variants in DashboardPage

## Changes Made

### 1. CourseCard Component (`components/CourseCard.tsx`)
- Added error handling for image loading with `onError` prop
- Ensured fallback to high-quality placeholder image when thumbnail fails to load
- Maintained existing animation and styling

### 2. CourseDetailsPage (`pages/CourseDetailsPage.tsx`)
- Added error handling for course thumbnail with `onError` prop
- Ensured consistent fallback image

### 3. DashboardPage (`pages/DashboardPage.tsx`)
- Fixed TypeScript errors with animation variants by importing `Transition` type
- Updated sample course data with high-quality thumbnail URLs:
  - Web Development Fundamentals: Programming course image
  - UI/UX Design Principles: Design course image
- Fixed animation variant typing issues

### 4. ProgressPage (`pages/ProgressPage.tsx`)
- Updated sample course thumbnails with high-quality images:
  - Cybersecurity course
  - Web Development course
  - Data Analysis course

### 5. CourseEditPage (`pages/CourseEditPage.tsx`)
- Added thumbnail preview section to show how the image will appear
- Added error handling for preview image
- Improved user experience when entering thumbnail URLs

## Improvements

1. **Better Fallback Images**: All components now use high-quality placeholder images from Unsplash instead of generic placeholders
2. **Error Handling**: Added `onError` handlers to all image elements to ensure fallback images are displayed when URLs are broken
3. **Sample Data Quality**: Updated all sample course data with relevant, high-quality images
4. **User Experience**: Added thumbnail preview in the course edit form
5. **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript errors in animation variants

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Open the application
2. Navigate to the Dashboard - verify that course cards display images properly
3. Go to the Courses page - verify that course cards display images properly
4. View individual course details - verify that course header images display properly
5. Check the Progress page - verify that course progress cards display images properly
6. Try creating or editing a course - verify that the thumbnail preview works correctly
7. Test error handling by entering invalid image URLs - verify that fallback images are displayed

## Files Modified

- `components/CourseCard.tsx`
- `pages/CourseDetailsPage.tsx`
- `pages/DashboardPage.tsx`
- `pages/ProgressPage.tsx`
- `pages/CourseEditPage.tsx`

These changes ensure that course images are displayed consistently throughout the application with proper fallback handling and improved visual quality.
