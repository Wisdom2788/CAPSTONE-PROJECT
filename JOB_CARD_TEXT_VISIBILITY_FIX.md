# Job Card Text Visibility Fix

## Issues Identified

The contents/texts in the job cards had the same visibility issues as the course cards:
1. Missing proper dark mode text colors
2. Insufficient contrast in dark mode
3. No visual separation with borders and shadows

## Changes Made

### 1. JobCard Component (`components/JobCard.tsx`)
- Added explicit dark mode text colors for better visibility:
  - Job title: `dark:text-white`
  - Company name: `dark:text-gray-300`
  - Location: `dark:text-gray-300`
  - Skill tags: `dark:text-gray-300`
  - Briefcase icon: `dark:text-blue-400`
- Enhanced card styling with:
  - Border: `border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700`
  - Background: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800`
  - Shadows: `shadow-lg dark:shadow-xl`
  - Rounded corners: `rounded-xl`

## Improvements

1. **Enhanced Dark Mode Visibility**: Added explicit dark mode text colors for better contrast
2. **Visual Consistency**: Applied the same styling improvements as CourseCard for consistency
3. **Better Visual Separation**: Added borders and enhanced shadows for better card definition

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Open the application in both light and dark modes
2. Navigate to the Jobs page - verify that all text in job cards is clearly visible
3. Check the Dashboard page - verify that job cards in "Recommended Job Openings" section have visible text
4. Toggle between light and dark modes - verify that text remains readable in both themes
5. Check all text elements:
   - Job title
   - Company name
   - Location
   - Skill tags
   - Job type badges

## Files Modified

- `components/JobCard.tsx`

These changes ensure that all text content in job cards is clearly visible and readable in both light and dark modes, with proper contrast and appropriate coloring for each text element, maintaining consistency with the CourseCard styling.
