# Course Card Visibility Improvements

## Issues Identified

The course cards were blending too much with the background, making them almost unnoticeable. This was due to:
1. Insufficient contrast between card background and page background
2. Weak box shadows that didn't create enough visual separation
3. Lack of border definition in light mode

## Changes Made

### 1. CourseCard Component (`components/CourseCard.tsx`)
- Added explicit border styling: `border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700`
- Enhanced shadow classes: `shadow-lg dark:shadow-xl`
- Ensured proper background colors: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800`
- Maintained rounded corners: `rounded-xl`

### 2. CSS Styles (`index.css`)
- Updated card shadow variables for better visibility:
  - Light mode: Kept existing subtle shadows for a clean look
  - Dark mode: Significantly enhanced shadows for better contrast
    - Normal state: `0 10px 25px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25), 0 8px 10px -6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)`
    - Hover state: `0 20px 25px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0 8px 10px -6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)`
- Updated the `.card` component class to include:
  - Border definition: `border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700`
  - Maintained existing properties with enhanced visibility

### 3. Consistency Across Pages
- Verified card implementation in CoursesPage and DashboardPage
- Ensured consistent spacing and animation behavior

## Improvements

1. **Better Visual Separation**: Enhanced box shadows create more distinct separation between cards and background
2. **Improved Contrast**: Added borders provide clear definition in both light and dark modes
3. **Consistent Styling**: Applied uniform styling across all instances of CourseCard
4. **Responsive Design**: Maintained responsive behavior while improving visibility

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Open the application in both light and dark modes
2. Navigate to the Courses page - verify that course cards are clearly visible with proper shadows
3. Check the Dashboard page - verify that course cards in "Continue Where You Left Off" section are clearly visible
4. Toggle between light and dark modes - verify that cards maintain good visibility in both themes
5. Hover over cards - verify that the enhanced hover effect with stronger shadows works properly

## Files Modified

- `components/CourseCard.tsx`
- `index.css`

These changes ensure that course cards are much more visible and noticeable throughout the application while maintaining a clean, professional appearance.
