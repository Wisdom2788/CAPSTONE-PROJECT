# Remove Dashboard Buttons

## Changes Made

Removed the "Explore Courses" and "View Job Board" buttons from the welcome back card in the DashboardPage.

### Files Modified

- `pages/DashboardPage.tsx`

## Details

The buttons were removed from the hero section of the dashboard page to simplify the interface. The welcome back card now only contains:
- Welcome message with user's first name
- Description text about continuing the journey
- A visual dashboard illustration with YouthGuard branding

This change creates a cleaner, more focused dashboard experience for users.

## Testing

To test this change:

1. Open the application and navigate to the Dashboard page
2. Verify that the "Explore Courses" and "View Job Board" buttons are no longer visible in the welcome back card
3. Confirm that the layout still looks balanced and visually appealing
4. Ensure that users can still access courses and jobs through the main navigation or other sections of the dashboard

## Impact

This change simplifies the user interface by removing redundant navigation options, as users can access courses and jobs through the main navigation sidebar.
