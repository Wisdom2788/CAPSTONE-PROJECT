## Changes Made

### 1. Theme Context Configuration
- Updated `contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` to set dark mode as the default theme
- Modified the initial state to `true` for dark mode
- Ensured that the theme preference is saved to localStorage

### 2. CSS Variables
- Updated `index.css` with appropriate background colors:
  - Light mode: `#ffffff` (brighter background)
  - Dark mode: `#0f172a` (current dark background)

### 3. Landing Page Animations
- Fixed TypeScript errors in `pages/LandingPage.tsx` related to Framer Motion animations
- Corrected animation configurations to use proper types
- Ensured all animations work correctly with the updated theme

### 4. Layout Component
- Updated `components/Layout.tsx` to ensure:
  - Sidebar is visible on large screens (using `lg:block` class)
